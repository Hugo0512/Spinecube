All codes for deep-learning convolutional neural networks were executed in the Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) framework with Ubuntu 16.04 64bit + CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture).

The codes for Faster-RCNN were executed in the Caffe (Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding) framework with Ubuntu 16.04 64bit + CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture). Please refer to https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn to obtain Faster-RCNN and the specification of it.

The trainning data is grouped in four groups (0-10 degree, 11-20 degree, 21-45 degree, larger than 45 degree).
